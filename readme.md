## My process
Came across Frontend Mentor through a FreeCodeCamp course on HTML and CSS for beginners. As a beginner to coding myself, I found the course and challenge to be very helpful in learning basic concepts as well as the practical knowledge that comes with writing the code yourself. 

### Built with
Semantic HTML5 markup
CSS custom properties
Visual Studio Code

### What I learned
How to write CSS rules using class selectors, that div elements are useful to group HTML content to follow specific style rules, differences between padding, margins and borders, and the existence of button elements. Also, how to add hover states and making use of browser Devtools to find best styling choices. 

### Continued development
Will work out more challenges like these to get better at assigning my own format values. Because the course focused mainly on the basics of building HTML content, stuff like font sizes and margins were given, which did help me get familiar with the dimensions used (prior to this course I wouldn't have a clue as to what a 20px margin is supposed to look like). Looking forward to try my luck without the helping hand.
